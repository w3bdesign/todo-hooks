# React TODO with Hooks

The initial release of this project only used useState for state.

I have now done a major refactor in order to use Immer, useImmerReducer and useContext.

## Current features:

-   Ant Design version 4.23.1 with the following components: Table, Row, Col, Popconfirm, Icon, Typography and Popup notification
-   React 18 with hooks (useState and useContext)
-   State management with Immer and useImmerReducer hook
-   Add, delete and complete TODOs
-   Ant Design filter functionality - hide completed TODOs
-   Ant Design DatePicker for date selection
-   UUID for unique React key identifier
-   Pagination (multiple pages) for table
-   Responsive layout for mobile devices
-   DevOps integration with CircleCI unit testing
-   SonarGate cloud code quality testing
