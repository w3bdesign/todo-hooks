# React TODO with Hooks

Currently working on a major refactor.

Check out the dev branch for updated progress.

## Current features:

- Ant Design version 4 with the following components: Table, Row, Col, Popconfirm, Icon, Typography, Popup notification
- React Hooks (useState)
- Add, delete and complete TODOs
- Uuid for unique React key identifier
- Pagination (multiple pages) for table
- Polyfills for IE11 support
- Responsive layout for mobile devices
- DevOps integration with CircleCI unit testing

## TODO

- Firebase and Firestore (or LocalStorage?) for authentication and storage of TODOs
- Implement more components from Ant design?
- Add more tests
